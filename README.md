- 👋 Hi, I’m @temanbecki1
- 👀 I recently retired from the US NAVY. I am interested in Software Engineering roles.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Java and JavaScript. I am moreso focused on Java development as this will translate to android mobile application development.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on various projects to gain valuable industry experience. 
- I am interested in all programming projects as I transverse the field to find the exact fit for my unique skillset.

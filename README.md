Hello, I'm Teman Beck ðŸ‘‹
About Me

Iâ€™m a software engineer with a unique journey from the high seas to high tech. My career began on the deck of a $10 billion America-class amphibious assault ship as an Electrician's Mate in the US Navy, where I honed my leadership skills and electrical expertise. Transitioning from military service, I leveraged my problem-solving abilities and dove headfirst into the world of software development.

Fueled by a lifelong passion for technology, kindled by the release of World of Warcraft in 2004, I've cultivated a broad skill set that spans full-stack development, from Java and JavaScript to SQL, React, and Redux. With a formal background in software development, certified by Fullstack Academy, and enriched by extensive Computer Science studies at the University of Maryland Global Campus, I craft innovative solutions that address complex challenges.
